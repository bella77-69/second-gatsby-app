Set up a Gatsby project and learned the fundamentals.  I was able to create Gatsby pages and load dynamic content to my site.
I was then introduced to the different ways of styling a Gatsby site. In addition to global styling, it was also covered how I can scope component styles locally using the CSS Modules to avoid the risk of name conflicts with any CSS selector.

After that, I learned how to set up a basic SEO for my Gatsby site. And lastly, I learned how to deploy my site to Netlify.
